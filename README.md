Greetings, fellow developers! üëã

Empower your creativity with Mech-DLK SDK, ready for you to unleash your programming prowess. Start crafting your own applications today!

## What's Mech-DLK SDK
Mech-DLK SDK is a secondary development software kit specifically designed to be used with [Mech-DLK](https://www.mech-mind.com/product/mech-dlk-deep-learning-software.html). It mainly helps you easily do deep learning inference in your software systems. With Mech-DLK SDK, you can rapidly deploy deep learning models and flexibly integrate deep learning functionality into your own applications without reliance on [Mech-Vision](https://www.mech-mind.com/product/mech-vision-machine-vision-software.html). Currently, development in C#, C++, and C languages is supported.

üì• If you need to install Mech-DLK, please go to [Download Center](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-dlk) to get the Mech-DLK Installer (version 2.4.2 or above). You can contact us at info@mech-mind.net to learn more about license dongles.

üí° If you have any questions or have anything to share regarding our SDK, feel free to post on [Mech-Mind Online Community](https://community.mech-mind.com/). 

## How to install Mech-DLK SDK

### ‚ùóPrerequisites
1. Make sure that you've purchased Mech-DLK's Pro-Train/Pro-Run license dongle.
2. It is recommended that the used device should satisfy the following requirements:

|Authorized dongle version | Pro-Run | Pro-Train
|  :----  | :----:  | :----:
|Operating system |Windows 10 or above |Windows 10 or above
|CPU |Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-6700 or above |Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-6700 or above
|Memory |8GB or above |16GB or above
|Graphics card |GeForce GTX 1660 or above |GeForce RTX 3060 or above
|Graphics card driver |Version 472.50 or above |Version 472.50 or above

### ‚úÖ Installation steps


1. Create a local project folder on your device, such as *dlk_sdk*.

2. Clone the repository of [Mech-DLK SDK](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/tree/v2.0.2) to the project folder.

3. Download the third-party libraries (3rd_dll.zip) and resources (resources.zip) that Mech-DLK SDK relies on to the project folder from [Download Center](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-dlk-sdk).

4. Unzip the downloaded packages of third-party libraries and resources.

## üìå C# samples
Two categories of samples are provided: **Basic** and **Advanced**.

### Basic
Samples using models exported from Mech-DLK to do inference of single images and simultaneous inference of images as well as obtain and visualize results.

- [ImageInfer](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/v2.0.2/samples/csharp/Basic/ImageInfer/ImageInfer.cs): a sample for inference of single images (both single models and cascaded models are supported).
